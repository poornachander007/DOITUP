**Day 2 - PostgreSQL Learning Overview**

1. **Database and Table Creation**
   - Created `learning_db` database.
   - Created `users` table with columns: `id`, `name`, `email`, `age`, `created_at`.

2. **Data Insertion**
   - Inserted initial data into `users` table.
   - Populated with sample users for testing queries.

3. **Basic SQL Queries**
   - **SELECT Statements**
     - Retrieved all data.
     - Filtered results by `age` > 30 and by `name` pattern matching.
   - **UPDATE and DELETE**
     - Updated age for specific users.
     - Deleted user with name 'Charlie'.

4. **Table Manipulations**
   - **CREATE and DROP**
     - Created and dropped dummy table `dummyTable`.
   - **ALTER**
     - Added `address` column to `users`.

5. **Sorting and Distinct Results**
   - Sorted `users` by `age` in ascending order.
   - Retrieved unique ages.

6. **LIMIT and OFFSET**
   - Limited results to first row, with offsets for further testing.

7. **GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses**
   - Grouped by `age` and counted users.
   - Filtered grouped results with `HAVING`.

8. **Logical Operators**
   - Used `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` in various queries.
   - Tested value ranges with `IN`, `BETWEEN`.

9. **Aggregate Functions**
   - **COUNT**, **SUM**, **MIN**, **MAX**, **AVG** on user age.
   - Converted `name` values to uppercase and lowercase.

10. **Additional Functions**
    - **Date and Casting**
      - Used `strftime()` to retrieve current date.
      - Used `CAST()` to convert values.
    - **Rounding Functions**
      - `FLOOR()`, `CEIL()`, `ROUND()` applied to numbers.

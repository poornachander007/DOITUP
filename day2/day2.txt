Day 2 - PostgreSQL Learning Overview

1. Database and Table Creation
   - Created the `users` table with columns: id, name, email, age, created_at.
   - Inserted sample data into the `users` table.

2. Basic SQL Queries
   - Selected all rows from the `users` table.
   - Filtered rows where age > 30.
   - Used `LIKE` to find users with names containing "Bob".

3. Data Manipulation
   - Updated Bobâ€™s age to 26.
   - Deleted user "Charlie" from the table.

4. Table Alterations
   - Created `dummyTable` and dropped it afterward.
   - Added an `address` column to the `users` table.

5. Sorting and Distinct Values
   - Ordered users by age in ascending order.
   - Retrieved unique ages from the `users` table.

6. Row Limiting and Offsetting
   - Limited output to 1 row.
   - Limited output to 10 rows, starting from the second row.

7. Grouping and Filtering
   - Grouped users by age, counted each group.
   - Applied `HAVING` to filter grouped ages between 20 and 30.

8. Operators
   - Used `<>` and `NOT IN` for age exclusion.
   - Combined conditions with `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, and `BETWEEN`.

9. Aggregate Functions
   - Counted users, summed and averaged ages, found minimum and maximum ages.

10. String and Number Functions
    - Converted names to uppercase and lowercase.
    - Used `strftime` to get the current date.
    - Cast numbers, applied `FLOOR`, `CEIL`, and `ROUND` functions.
